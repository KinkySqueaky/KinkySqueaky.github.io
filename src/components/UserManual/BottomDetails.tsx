          <Header>Service Nature</Header>
          <Body>
            I'm definitely a service-oriented person at heart. Sometimes this is
            passive service as in letting people use me as they see fit. Other
            times this is active service as in doing things for people with or
            without being ordered to. And sometimes it's a mixture of both
            passive and active service. How the service looks depends on my
            relationship with the person I'm playing with, so we'll feel that
            out as needed if it's a direction we want to explore.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            One of my biggest things is making myself look visually appealing
            and then serving a partner. Being told exactly how to look for
            someone is extremely hot to me and a surefire way to get me into a
            service subby headspace for a scene. I often get decision paralysis
            about how to look, so this also works around that issue and removes
            one layer of anxiety for me. There's not a lot of text here so it
            might take some more emphasizing but this is one of my biggest
            turn-ons, straight up. Tell me how to make myself look (or even
            better, make me look a way) and I'll just fucking{" "}
            <em>
              <strong>melt</strong>
            </em>{" "}
            for you.

          <Header>Bondage (Rope and Non-Rope)</Header>
          <Body>
            Rope play is very much up there on my list of types of play I enjoy.
            As a bottom, I have some problems with many restrictive positions,
            so I tend to stick more to decorative ties when starting off with a
            partner, then moving into more restrictive ties as the top gets to
            know my body. I'm not super flexible yet, but it's something I'm
            working on and can hopefully use in rope bottoming. I've also ended
            up in a position where I really like being a bottom for rope but I
            end up doing more topping than bottoming, so I'll probably jump at
            opportunities to be tied up without having to self-tie. I do really
            like self-ties too, but that doesn't cleanly fall into topping or
            bottoming so I'm putting it here anyway.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            I haven't done a ton of non-rope bondage, but I think I'd really
            enjoy the restrictive feeling of it. One form of non-rope bondage
            that I know I really enjoy is being held down by someone while they
            do something to me or while someone else does something. It brings
            out primal feelings in me that often don't come out in other ways,
            so it's something I'd love to do again.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            Some positions that cause problems for me (a non-exhaustive list):
            <ul>
              <li>Tight futos</li>
              <li>Arms behind back for long periods of time</li>
              <li>Any position that stretches my hamstrings a lot</li>
              <li>
                Really anything that puts a lot of pressure on my knees or
                shoulders
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Body>

          <Header>Pain (Including but not Limited to Impact)</Header>
          <Body>
            I tend to say I've got a low pain threshold, but it's dependent on
            so many different factors that I can't even pinpoint it sometimes.
            I'm kind of a little bitch about stingy pain. My tolerance for it is
            pretty low and it's easy for me to tap out quickly if I'm not
            properly warmed up. I love thuddy pain though, especially on my
            butt. Thuddy pain elsewhere is hit or miss, and the human body is
            fragile so like, I'm gonna have to get comfortable with your skill
            set and knowledge before I do thuddy away from the butt or thighs.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            Biting and scratching are also types of pain that I really{" "}
            <em>really</em>
            enjoy, especially with bites if there's a little tug at the skin or
            if it's on my neck. The back is also a fantastic spot for biting and
            scratching. I've almost had an orgasm just from being bitten the
            right way which is somewhat embarrassing but also kind of
            fascinating to me because I would absolutely not use "painslut" as a
            descriptor for myself. For all other types of pain, those can be
            discussed individually.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            I'm likely to cry once a certain pain threshold is reached (it
            varies with headspace), and it's possible that I have a nervous
            laughter right before I break down crying. I'm able to keep taking
            pain after I've started crying. It can be a little unnerving or
            quite hot depending who you ask, but be aware that if I really need
            to stop, I'll safeword. If we want to play in a range that is likely
            to make me cry, we should discuss it ahead of time so we can be sure
            that we're both mentally prepared for it.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            I don't actually like receiving pain for the sake of pain! I enjoy
            the psychological and emotional states that suffering can bring
            about, and pain is a physical manifestation of suffering. There's an
            interplay between the physical and the emotional that makes me feel
            vulnerable. Oh, and I do love to see and feel the marks on my body
            from being beaten up.
          </Body>

          <Header>Pet Play</Header>
          <Body>
            I really love pet play, but it's not something I've been able to
            engage with in a prolonged or recurring way besides casual meowing.
            I'm either a human pet or a cat depending on my dynamic with a
            person. Sometimes it's a bit of both, especially if I'm really
            comfortable with someone. I love the feeling of ownership, and being
            a cuddly companion plays into my service side a bit. Pet play can
            also hit on longer term behavior modification which I'm super
            interested in trying out (it sounds really hot UwU~). There's the
            obedience and discipline aspect as well which plays on feelings of
            vulnerability for me. Excessive discipline can hit on the competence
            trigger, so rules definitely need to be explicitly negotiated with
            me.
          </Body>

          <Header>Hypnosis</Header>
          <Body>
            I listen to audio hypnosis files on occasion, and I like the feeling
            of helplessness that comes along with it. It's sometimes difficult
            to get my brain to shut up for it to work, but when it does work, I
            absolutely love it. I tend to focus on the auditory aspects of
            hypnosis, but exploring visual stimuli is something that I've been
            meaning to do for a while. I can't say I've played that much with
            implanting hypnotic triggers in myself, but it seems like an area
            that I'd like to explore with someone knowledgeable. There's a lot
            of neat stuff that can only be done in person and not through a
            pre-recorded file, and I'd like to explore that more. Hypnosis
            requires a lot more in-depth discussion with any partners I engage
            in this with, so I'll just leave it at this for now.
          </Body>

          <Header>Chastity</Header>
          <Body>
            I really like being locked up and frustrated about it. I'm still
            nervous about wearing a cage out in public because of the bulge it
            creates, but I enjoy being locked up as a form of ownership and
            denial. Being teased about being in a cage hits on notes of
            vulnerability for me, so if that's something you want to incorporate
            into a dynamic, I'd be happy to discuss it. This also mixes really
            well with edging and orgasm denial. Keeping myself perpetually horny
            and desperate to be used? Yeah, that sounds good to me, even if I
            fight it a bit while I'm needy &gt;.&lt;
          </Body>

          <Header>Sounding</Header>
          <Body>
            This one actually used to be a soft limit, but now it's one of my
            favorite things! I've mostly sounded myself and I've only ever used
            long flexible sounds. They're fun to wear under a chastity cage to
            catch people off guard when you take it off and pull a long sound
            out. Unfortunately, I can't keep them in suuuuuper long when doing
            this, so it's more of a short term gag/bit. I've tried using the
            urethral plug on my chastity cage. It's fun, but kinda impractical.
            I need to get a better one. I'd love to do more sounding and try
            more! It's not something that I'm actively going out of my way to
            explore, but if the opportunity arises... 👀

          <Header>CNC (Consensual Non-Consent)</Header>
          <Body>
            Ah, consensual non-consent, that real good shit. It definitely ramps
            up the vulnerable feelings, but it's not something I can do without
            a fairly deep level of trust. I do like to resist and fight back
            sometimes, but that's typically reserved for platonic kink. Because
            of my history with sexual assault, any CNC that's sexual needs to be
            meticulously planned. This kink is one that I usually reserve for
            private spaces, but with the right person I could be convinced to do
            it in a more public setting.
          </Body>

          <Header>Intoxication Play</Header>
          <Body>
            This is definitely not for everyone, but it's something I'm open to
            with people I'm comfortable with. I've definitely had the “drunk
            slut” fantasy where I become intoxicated and then get used by an
            individual, small group, or at a party. I fully understand that
            there's the issue of “you're drunk so you can't consent” which means
            everything will be worked out ahead of time. And there's also the
            whole “you're drunk so you're not able to reliably revoke consent”
            thing. That's something that I fully accept and will be part of a
            detailed negotiation.

          <Body>
            I've only tried needles a couple times and loved it every time! It's
            something I really want to explore more, but I get a feeling that
            this will be a slow journey for me. I find it to be quite
            meditative, and it created a feeling of calm and calculated
            vulnerability. So, uh, hi, hello, I'll be your pincushion.

          <Header>Electro Play</Header>
          <Body>
            I haven't done a ton of this but it's something I want to explore
            more of. I've tried a shock collar a couple times and really liked
            the sense of ownership and control it created. I tried a violet wand
            once, and I found that it was a little bit too ticklish at some
            settings. I don't think it's something I'd actively go out of my way
            to seek, but if I had a partner that enjoyed it, I'd be a willing
            victim.
